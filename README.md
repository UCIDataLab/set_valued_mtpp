# Probabilistic Modeling for Sequences of Sets in Continuous-Time

This repo includes code and data for our paper [Probabilistic Modeling for Sequences of Sets in Continuous-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15045) (Oral, AISTATS 2024). All datasets are publicly available, and we share our preprocessed versions. 

The codebase is adapted from [our previous code](https://github.com/ajboyd2/point_process_queries) for [Probabilistic Querying of Continuous-Time Event Sequences](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/boyd23a/boyd23a.pdf) (AISTATS 2023).
